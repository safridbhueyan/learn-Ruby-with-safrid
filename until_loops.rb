Certainly! This Ruby code sets up a loop using `until` that continues until the variable `i` equals `10`. Inside the loop:
- It prints the current value of `i` multiplied by `10`.
- `i` is incremented by `1` in each iteration. 
This process repeats until `i` reaches the value of `10`, at which point the loop stops.
